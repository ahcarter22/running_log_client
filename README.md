# Running Log

This application allows users to input and log their runs within an online database. A "run" consists of distance, type of shoe ran in, and assessment of difficulty. I wanted to do this project because, as a runner, I find it valuable to keep track of my runs and assess my training and progress.

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/main.zip) this template.
1. Unzip and rename the template directory (`unzip ~/Downloads/react-auth-template-main.zip`).
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1. Replace `react-auth-template` in `package.json` with your
   projects name.
1. Replace the `"homepage"` field in `package.json` with your (public) Github
   account name and repository name.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. `git add` and `git commit` your changes.
1. Run the development server with `npm start`.

## Deployment

Before deploying, you first need to make sure the `homepage` key in your
`package.json` is pointing to the correct value. It should be the url of your
deployed application.

To deploy you should first make sure you are on the `main` branch with a
clean working directory, then you can run `npm run deploy` and wait to see if
it runs successfully.


**NOTE**: You should customize the included components to suit you app! They're
provided as a guide and a bare minimum of functionality and style. Consider
changing the provided SCSS styles, modifying the auth code, improving the flash
messages, etc.

## Structure

The top-level `App` component stores the currently authenticated
user in state, as well as data related to the flash messages. `App` renders the
`Header` component, and a list of routes, each of which render a component from
`src/components`. The `src/api` directory has a component file, `auth.js`, which
contains all the needed `axios` calls pertaining to authentication.

You can follow this pattern in your app as well. For instance, if you are making
an app that keeps track of books, you might want a `src/api/books.js`, which
contains its own `axios` call pertaining to your books resource CRUD actions.
Using a separate directory within `components` for each individual component you
add makes it easy to locate and update components and has the added benefit of
making it easy to create custom styles that apply to that specific component.
To apply component specific styles, add a file to the component's directory such
as `ComponentName.scss` and then import it directly into the component with
`import './ComponentName.scss'`.  This will keep your styles modularized and
make it easier to make changes at the component level.

### Included Routes

This template comes with a handful of front-end routes that display
different components for user actions.

| Endpoint         | Component | `AuthenticatedRoute`? |
|------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `/sign-up`       | `SignUp`    | No |
| `/sign-in`       | `SignIn`    | No |
| `/change-password` | `ChangePassword`  | Yes |
| `/sign-out`        | `SignOut`   | Yes |

There is no HTTP verb listed because these are all front-end routes handled by
React. Some of these routes should not be available unless a user is signed in,
so they will use the `AuthenticatedRoute` component instead of the regular
`Route`. This custom component is provided as part of the template, and is not
a part of the React library (see more below).

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `npm run nag`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code and complains.
- `npm run make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard
  Style.
- `npm run start`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads.
- `npm run build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `npm run deploy`: builds and deploys main branch
